Buying as a guest

You can shop for most things on eBay without needing an account, but you’ll miss out on several benefits that come with being a registered member. Here’s how to buy as a guest: Once you’ve found an item you’d like to purchase, simply select the "Buy It Now" option on the listing. Then, choose "Check out as guest." You’ll be prompted to provide your shipping address, email address, and payment information. After filling out these details, confirm your purchase by selecting the "Confirm and pay" button. You can shop as a guest on eBay as long as the item costs less than $5,000 and is available through the "Buy It Now" option. If you want to place a bid on an auction listing or send a "Best Offer" to a seller, you will need to create an eBay account, as these features are not available for guest users. In terms of payment, you can use PayPal, credit card, debit card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay to complete your transaction as a guest.

Although you won’t have access to My eBay, which is the platform’s tool for managing and tracking your account activity, you can still keep track of your purchases as a guest. eBay will send you a guest order confirmation email after your purchase. The email will have the subject line “Order Confirmed” and will include the details of your purchase. This email is crucial because it contains links to view your order details, contact the seller, track your order, or initiate a return if necessary. If you happen to lose or delete this confirmation email, don’t worry—you can retrieve it by selecting the "Retrieve guest order confirmation email" button. You’ll be asked to enter the email address you used to make the purchase or the order number. Once you submit this information, eBay will resend the link to your order details.

Tracking your order as a guest is also straightforward. If the seller is using a tracked delivery service, you can follow your item’s journey to your shipping address. To do this, locate your guest order confirmation email, which starts with the subject line “Order Confirmed,” and click "View order details." Then, select "Show shipping details" to see a delivery status bar that includes the shipping company’s name, the tracking number, and the current location of your item. If you cannot see the tracking information, you can select "Contact seller" on the Order Details page to request that the seller upload the tracking number.

If you decide to become an eBay member after making a guest purchase, you can still register for an account. Keep in mind that your guest purchases will be managed separately from any future orders made after you create an account. To create an account, simply open your guest order confirmation email, select "View order details," and then click "Register" at the top of the page. Once you’ve registered, you’ll gain access to a range of benefits, including full order details for all purchases, the ability to bid on auction-style listings, leave feedback on purchases, send messages to other eBay members, and manage your transactions through the My eBay tool. Additionally, you’ll be able to participate in eBay’s community features, such as discussion boards and resources for buying and selling.
